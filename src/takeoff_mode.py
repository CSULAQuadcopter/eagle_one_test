"""
Makes the QC takeoff and increase altitude until it reaches a specified
altitude.
If the tag is lost, a timer is started and if the tag cannot be recovered
within a specified amount of time, it will enter the reacquisition mode. If the
tag is recovered within the specified amount of time, it will continue on with
its function (getting the QC to a specified height).
