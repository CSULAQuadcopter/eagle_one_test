"""
If the tag is lost, this will increase the altitude until a specified height
(or ceiling). Transitions to the previous state if the tag is acquired for a
certain amount of time, otherwise it lands the QC.

This inherits from the Mode class.

Subscribers:
    /smach/state to check state and turn on timers if we're in reacquisition
    and turn off if we'er not
    /smach/transition stores the transition to the state so that if the tag is
    reacquired within the specified amount of time, we know which state to go
    back to

Publishers:
    /cmd_vel to control the altitude of the QC
    /ardrone/land to land the QC
    /smach/transition to let the system know of a state change

Note: prev_state_timeout should be less than tag_timeout otherwise the QC will
      land before it has a lock on the tag for the specified amount of time.
